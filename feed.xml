These values can be arbitrarily large and outputted as integers, HEX values, or base64 encoded strings. The maximum amount of payloads that can be generated has been limited to 2 million to prevent crashing and/or freezing the browser and to prevent copying &amp;amp; pasting taking too long.

This method uses statistics (letter frequencies and use of common words, bigrams, and trigrams), so the cipher-text needs to be a decent size otherwise it won’t work. For an in-depth explanation of how this works, please read my post here.
