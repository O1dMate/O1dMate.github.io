This guide already assumes you have frida installed and have frida-server installed on your iOS device. For the below code examples, Snapchat was used as the target application. Basic iOS ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Cryptography - Byte by Byte ECB Decryption</title><link href="https://node-security.com/posts/cryptography-byte-by-byte-ecb-decryption/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cryptography - Byte by Byte ECB Decryption" /><published>2021-12-12T19:50:23+11:00</published> <updated>2021-12-12T20:20:22+11:00</updated> <id>https://node-security.com/posts/cryptography-byte-by-byte-ecb-decryption/</id> <content src="https://node-security.com/posts/cryptography-byte-by-byte-ecb-decryption/" /> <author> <name>Alexander Wells</name> </author> <category term="security" /> <category term="cryptography" /> <summary> In this post we’ll cover how to attack an oracle function that encrypts user supplied data concatenated with an unknown string under ECB mode while using a constant but unknown key. This post will assume you know what PKCS#7 padding is. If you’re unsure what this is, you can read my short post about it here. This post is also a solution to challenge 12 on the cryptopals website.

The method we’ll be using to break the encryption uses statistics (letter frequencies and use of common words, bigrams, and trigrams), so the cipher-text needs to be a decent size otherwise it won’t work. The key used can be any arbitrary number of bytes long, but in general,... </summary> </entry> </feed>
